# Meeting Recording Service - Codebase Context

## Project Overview
A robust Node.js service deployed on Railway that automatically handles meeting recordings from ChatterBox API, processes large video files, creates formatted transcripts, and integrates with Google Drive and Slack for seamless team collaboration.

## Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+ with Express.js
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **File Storage**: Google Drive API
- **Deployment**: Railway with auto-deploy from GitHub
- **Integrations**: ChatterBox API, Slack API, Google Calendar webhooks

## Current State
- ✅ Complete implementation deployed and operational
- ✅ ChatterBox integration with direct webhooks
- ✅ Google Calendar event storage and linking
- ✅ Meeting recording processing pipeline
- ✅ Google Drive file storage
- ✅ Slack notifications with proper meeting titles
- 🔧 Recently fixed: ChatterBox session linking to calendar events for proper meeting title retrieval

## Key Security Requirements
- NO API KEYS in source code - only in .env files
- .env files MUST be in .gitignore
- Highest security standards for credential handling

## Critical Technical Constraints
- ChatterBox recording URLs expire in 5 minutes - URGENT processing required
- Large .mkv file handling via streaming (no local storage)
- Stream directly to Google Drive to handle file size limitations
